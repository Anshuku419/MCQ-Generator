# MCQ-Generator
Project Description:
This project focuses on developing an intelligent system that automatically generates Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) from a given text or dataset using data science techniques. The goal is to assist educators and learners by automating the creation of quiz content for assessments, practice, and e-learning platforms.

Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models, the system extracts key concepts, identifies important sentences, and formulates grammatically correct questions. It then generates relevant distractors (incorrect but plausible options) to accompany the correct answer. The project leverages techniques like keyword extraction, sentence simplification, named entity recognition, and similarity scoring to ensure question quality.

# Key Features:
Automatic generation of MCQs from educational content.
Extraction of correct answers and generation of plausible distractors.
NLP-based preprocessing and text analysis.
User-friendly interface for uploading text and exporting questions.
Option to classify questions based on difficulty level or topic.
# Tools and Technologies Used:
Languages: Python
Libraries: NLTK, SpaCy, Scikit-learn, Transformers (BERT/DistilBERT), TextBlob
Frameworks: Flask/Streamlit (for deployment)
Other Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (for data handling and analysis)
# Applications:
E-learning platforms and digital education tools.
Online test preparation systems.
Automated assessment tools for institutions
